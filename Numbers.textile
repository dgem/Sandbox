h1. Number Puzzle

Take a number and give the equivalent number in British English words, without using a tokenizer, or any external libraries, clever regexâ€™s or the like.
For example:
* 1 = one
* 27 = twenty seven
* 115 = one hundred and fifteen
* 3700 = three thousand seven hundred
* 56945781 = fifty six million nine hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred and eighty one
* 126000010 = one hundred and twenty six million and ten
* etc.. 
* up to 999999999 = nine hundred and ninety nine million nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine... I think ;)
